# Car Sales Data Analysis and EDA

## Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a car sales dataset using Python. The goal is to understand trends and relationships in car prices, manufacturers, engine sizes, mileage, and fuel types through visualizations and summary statistics.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following key attributes:
- Manufacturer
- Model
- Engine Size (liters)
- Fuel Type (Petrol, Diesel, etc.)
- Year of Manufacture
- Mileage (in miles/km)
- Price (in local currency)

## Features Explored
- Distribution of cars by Manufacturer and Fuel Type
- Price distributions across Manufacturers
- Correlation analysis between numerical features (Price, Mileage, Engine Size, Year)
- Pair plots to explore relationships between numerical variables
- Price trends over years of manufacture

## Technologies & Libraries
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
